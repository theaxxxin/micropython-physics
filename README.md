# The age of micropython is here! #
A particle engine for an OLED display.
Right now, two particles are initialized on boot and they will fly at each other. When they collide, they bounce away with a velocity relative to their mass
A basic engine for particles and collision detection on Micropython.
Currently running on a generic ESP32 Dev Board with a 1.3Inch SH1106 OLED Display

Code ported from Mattia Conti's youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN7uBodTAg8KcsuDiJ9u4Rg
The circuit is very simple, as shown below:
